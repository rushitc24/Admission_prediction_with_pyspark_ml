# Admission_prediction_with_pyspark_ml

Project Structure
The hands on project on Graduate Admission Prediction with Pyspark ML is divided into following tasks:

**Task 1: Introduction and Installing dependencies**
   
    Introduction to the project

    Install Pyspark on the Google Colab Environment

**Task 2: Clone and explore the Dataset**
    
    Clone the admission dataset from the Github repository

    Explore the dataset to get the summary statistics , rows and column details.

**Task 3: Data Cleaning**
    
    Drop the unnecessary columns of the dataframe

    Check for the null values

**Task 4: Correlation analysis and Feature Selection**
    
    Apply correlation analysis between the set of input and the output variables

    Selection of features based on the highly correlated values

**Task 5: Build the Linear Regression Model**
    
    Split the dataset into training and the testing set

    Build and Train the Linear Regression Model

**Task 6: Evaluate and test the model**
    
    Evaluate the Model

    Save and load the model back to the environment
